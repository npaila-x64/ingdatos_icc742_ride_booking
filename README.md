# Ride Booking ETL with Prefect - Medallion Architecture (Apache Iceberg)

A production-ready ETL pipeline implementing the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for ride booking analytics. This project processes ride booking data from CSV files into a multi-layered analytical data lakehouse using **Prefect** orchestration and **Apache Iceberg** storage.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a complete ETL pipeline that:
- **Extracts** ride booking data from CSV files into a Bronze (raw) layer
- **Transforms** data into a normalized Silver (dimensional) layer
- **Aggregates** analytics into a Gold (metrics) layer
- **Orchestrates** the entire pipeline with Prefect workflows

### Key Features

✅ **Medallion Architecture** - Industry-standard data lake pattern (Bronze → Silver → Gold)  
✅ **Apache Iceberg** - Modern table format with ACID transactions and time travel  
✅ **Prefect Orchestration** - Robust workflow management with retries and monitoring  
✅ **Schema Evolution** - Seamless schema changes without rewriting data  
✅ **Time Travel** - Query historical data snapshots  
✅ **Idempotent Operations** - Safe to re-run with upsert logic  
✅ **Type Safety** - Pydantic models and type hints throughout
